An intelligent machine learning model that accurately predicts the market value of used cars based on their features and specifications.

Overview-
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict used car prices using the Random Forest algorithm. By analyzing various car attributes like Year, Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission, and Owner history, the model helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the used car market.


Key Features-
Random Forest Regressor: Implemented powerful ensemble learning technique
Feature Analysis: Considers car age, present price, kilometers driven, and more
Categorical Handling: Proper encoding of categorical features like fuel type and transmission
Visualization: Includes data visualization to understand feature relationships
Streamlit App: Interactive web application for easy interaction with the model


Technology Stack
Language: Python
ML Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
Model Type: Random Forest Regressor
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Web Framework: Streamlit
Data: Car features including Year, Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, etc.
Model Performance
The Random Forest Regressor model achieves excellent prediction accuracy on the test data. The model accurately captures the relationships between car features and their selling prices.


üìä How It Works
Data Preprocessing: The raw car data is processed to handle categorical variables and prepare features
Feature Engineering: Creates useful feature 'Car_Age' based on Year
Model Training: Trains a Random Forest Regressor model with optimized hyperparameters
Prediction: Processes user input and returns the predicted selling price
Streamlit Interface: Provides an interactive, user-friendly web interface to interact with the model


üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements
Implement additional regression algorithms for comparison
Add more advanced feature engineering techniques
Enhance the web interface with more detailed predictions
Deploy the model to a cloud platform for wider accessibility
Add time-series analysis for price trend predictions
